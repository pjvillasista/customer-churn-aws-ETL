# Data Processing & Analytics Pipeline with AWS and Airflow

This repository outlines a data processing and analytics pipeline leveraging AWS services and Apache Airflow. The main objective is to automate the process of fetching data, storing it in AWS, processing with Glue and Athena, saving to Redshift, and visualizing it using PowerBI.

## Diagram Overview

![Pipeline Diagram](path_to_your_image.png)

1. **Data Download**: Source data from the Internet.
2. **Amazon S3**: Store data in an S3 bucket.
3. **AWS Glue Crawler**: Extract schema and create metadata tables.
4. **Amazon Athena**: Query data directly from S3.
5. **Amazon Redshift**: Store processed data for complex analytics.

## Code Structure

- Apache Airflow DAG: Automates data transfer from S3 to Redshift using AWS Glue.

### Workflow:

1. Trigger the AWS Glue job to transfer data from S3 to Redshift.
2. Fetch the Glue job's run ID.
3. Monitor the Glue job's status using a sensor.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with permissions to S3, Glue, Athena, and Redshift.
- Apache Airflow setup.
- PowerBI account for visualization.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Configure your AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. Set up your Apache Airflow environment.

4. Place the DAG in your Airflow DAGs directory.

### Usage

1. Start the Airflow web server:
   ```bash
   airflow webserver
   ```

2. Trigger the DAG from the Airflow UI.

3. Once data is processed and saved in Redshift, use PowerBI to connect to your Redshift cluster for visualization.
